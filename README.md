<h2> Academic Team Project Examples </h2>

- <b> Graduate ML Final Project: </b> Objective to design and compare several ML models to operate on clinical information to classify stages of dementia in support of diagnosis. The convolutional neural network (CNN) selected for the final product utilized MRI images as input and classified between stages of Alzheimerâ€™s disease with 97.9% accuracy vs. typical medical professional accuracy ranging from 77-97%. 

- <b> Undergrad Senior Design Project: </b> Acted as team lead, tasked with designing a modular machine data acquisition system for assembly lines at GKN Automotive. The final product sampled real-time measurements of temperature, humidity, and vibration and generated email notifications if any readings reached a customizable threshold. 

- <b> Graduate Computer Vision Final Project: </b> Acted as team lead, tasked with designing and building a ML model in Python to perform image segmentation on photomosaic images of coral reefs. The final model was able to take input of photomosaic image patches and classify two specific species of coral if present in each image patch for the Coral Reef Foundation. 

- <b> Undergrad ML Final Project: </b> Objective to implement a ML model in Python that analyzes a set of symptoms provided by the user and returns a predicted diagnosis. The final product allowed the user to correspond with the chatbot, specify the number of symptoms, list these symptoms, and receive a predicted diagnosis.
